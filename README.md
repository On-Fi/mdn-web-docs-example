Notes:
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.



- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is the code that styles web content. Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.

CSS layout is mostly based on the box model. Each box taking up space on your page has properties like:

padding, the space around the content. In the example below, it is the space around the paragraph text.
border, the solid line that is just outside the padding.
margin, the space around the outside of the border.


- JavaScript
JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.
