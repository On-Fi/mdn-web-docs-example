Notes:
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.



- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is the code that styles web content. Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.



- JavaScript
JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. It was invented by Brendan Eich.
